          <h1>Instructions</h1>

          <p>Each card has 1 of 3 colors (red, green, blue), 1 of 3 shape counts (1, 2, 3), 1 of 3 shadings (solid,
            open, striped), and 1 of 3 shapes (oval, squiggle, diamond). A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the
            cards' features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card. All of the
            features must separately satisfy this rule.</p>
          <p>Players attempt to identify SETs from the cards on the table. If a SET was correctly identified, the SET
            removed from the table and the player earns one point. The dealer (the computer) will then deal three cards
            such that there are at least 12 cards on the table and there is at least one SET. Play continues until the
            deck is depleted and there are no more possible SETs to be identified.</p>
          <p>A set of cards can be selected from the table by clicking on them, and clicking the "Check" button will
            verify if an actual SET has been identified or not. Clicking the "Get Hint" button will highlight two cards
            that comprise a SET in yellow.</p>
